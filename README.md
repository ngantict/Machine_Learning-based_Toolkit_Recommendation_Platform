This is my bachelor's thesis with the topic "Machine Learning-based Toolkit Recommendation Platform".

The goal of this thesis is to create a platform for recommending toolkits that are suitable for new projects and processing data from old platforms.

The code files in this include: main and other. In the main file, make sure you run the code files in the following order:

1. import_library.py
2. LightGBM_rbr.py
3. Cosine_checkduplicate.py
4. preprocessing_v2.py
5. NN_LabelEncoding.py

The remaining files in other are my test files with different models to find the best performing model.

Currently, the LightGBM with row by row model gives the best results. The Neural Network row by row model is buggy and I haven't fixed it yet.

Please feel free to take the data file for your own use if you need it. To get the processed data file, run step 3 Cosine_checkduplicate to get it.

For more details, please refer to the attached thesis. And please contact me if you need more information.

Best regards, 
Thien Nga
